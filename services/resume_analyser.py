        Compare the following resume chunk and job description. Provide a structured JSON response with the requested fields. Focus on providing consistent and concise results based only on explicit matches and clearly inferred insights from the content. Use the following format:

            "experience": "Percentage match number for experience based on job description required experience.",

        - Be precise and consistent in evaluating skills and experience.
        - Use explicit text matches and clearly inferred data to populate the JSON fields.
        - For percentages, calculate based on the number of matches relative to the total number of requirements in the job description.
        - Avoid redundant or vague information.
        - Respond in strict JSON format without any additional explanation.
        - All percentage values should be integers (no floating points) and should not include % symbols.
