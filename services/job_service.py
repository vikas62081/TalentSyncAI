            "company": "The name of the company associated with the contact person. Look for references to the employer or organization explicitly mentioned in the description.",
            "title": "The title of the job position (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst). Use explicit headings or key phrases like 'Position' or 'Role'.",

        **Guidelines**:
        - If any field is missing from the job description, set its value to `null` or an empty array, as appropriate.
        - Strictly adhere to the provided JSON structure.
        - Validate the JSON structure for accuracy before returning.
        - Ensure all extracted information is precise, concise, and matches explicitly stated content in the job description.
        - Respond in strict JSON format without additional explanations or errors.
